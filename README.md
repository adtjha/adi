# adi [PROJECT ABANDONED]
This repository is used for my personal portfolio website. It is a content management system, coded from the ground up.
## About the Website
- It's a content managment system made with raw javascript on the front end part.
- you can upload blogs, pictures, videos, music.
  - manage your uploads also.
  - manage your assests(i.e., pictures, videos, music).  
- [TO BE MADE] Project Management System. 

### What is it basically ?
- it's a Content Manangement System. I designed this 2 years ago using vanilla js.

### What did I abandon it ?
- Short answer would be, I was bored. But coding in vanilla js taught me some valuable lessons which are
  - You can basically make any piece of software using vanilla js.
  - But there's a catch, nothing comes for free, coding everything in vanilla js is definitely possible, but most of the time, your project will end up in a mess.
  - That's why now I use JS frameworks such as React, Polymer(I used it long time back, when it was in its second year of release). Frameworks help you code in modules, which keep your project clean and in a readable format.

### Here's how it looks, and Yes it works.
